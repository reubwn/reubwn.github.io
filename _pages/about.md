Bio
=====

Welcome to my website! I am an evolutionary biologist with broad interests in the interaction between genome structure and the processes of adaptation, diversification and speciation in non-model eukaryotes. I work with whole-genome sequence data in conjunction with population genomic and comparative phylogenetic methods to provide insights into how these mechanisms contribute to the evolutionary process. I am particularly interested in the interaction between ecology, life-history and genome structure, the impact of extraordinary molecular mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, and the insights to be gained from the genomic peculiarities of non-model organisms.
